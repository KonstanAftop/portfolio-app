Konstan Aftop Anewata Ndruru, who also goes by Konstan, Aftop, or Waru, is a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer currently completing his undergraduate studies at the Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB), with a major in Meteorology and a minor in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. Originally from Nias Island, he moved to Bandung for his higher education, where he has built a strong interdisciplinary foundation combining atmospheric science with modern AI-driven approaches. His work spans the development of end-to-end AI systems for spatial data, audio signal processing, and time series forecasting. Konstan's passion lies in applying AI to solve environmental and public-impact challenges, a goal driven by his curiosity, adaptability, and a firm commitment to lifelong learning. His technical skill set is comprehensive, featuring proficiency in programming and tools like Python, Git, and Linux. For data analysis, he leverages NumPy, Pandas, and Xarray, while his machine learning and AI capabilities are centered around scikit-learn and TensorFlow, with experience in NLP. He is also adept at web and model deployment using frameworks such as Flask, Streamlit, and LangChain.

His professional experience reflects his academic and personal drive. He recently graduated with distinction, finishing in the top 10% of 2,500 students in the Machine Learning Engineer path at the Coding Camp by DBS Foundation, which ran from February to July 2025. During this intensive program, he developed numerous individual projects and, as part of a team, significantly improved a baby cry detection model's accuracy to 91% for the SuaTalk application. Concurrently, from January to May 2025, he applied his domain expertise as a Climate Data Analyst in a research collaboration between ITB and PLN, where he analyzed Global Climate Model outputs to assess future rainfall's impact on hydropower potential. To support his studies, Konstan also serves as a part-time Calculus Tutor for first-year ITB students at MasterTPB and has been an Academic Assistant for statistics and computation courses at ITB since August 2023. Previously, he tutored junior high school students in mathematics and physics at Bimbel Logos.

His extensive project portfolio showcases his ability to translate theory into practice and build solutions from end to end. In the SuaTalk team project, he served as the ML Engineer, where he improved the baby cry classification modelâ€™s accuracy to 91% which enhanced its reliability; handled imbalanced audio datasets and experimented with different ANN architectures and hyperparameters; collaborated with a backend engineer to deploy the trained model into a production-ready web application for real-time usage; integrated model predictions into fine-tuned generative AI prompts using Google Vertex AI to generate personalized care recommendations; and gained valuable experience in cross-functional collaboration and AI deployment. Bridging his major with automation, he personally developed the Rain Classifier - WCPL ITB, for which he initiated and developed the tool to automate the detection of rainfall categories from forecast maps using color thresholding; solved inefficiencies in a weather verification course by automating pixel-based rainfall classification from spatial weather forecast images; deployed the tool via a GitHub Actions cron job for daily automated execution, reducing manual workload by up to 50% and improving consistency; and designed the system to support research workflows in meteorology with minimal overhead and reproducible output. To improve data accessibility for non-programmers, he created the PM2.5 HAQAST Downloader GUI, where he created a GUI-based downloader to simplify the process of obtaining PM2.5 data from the HAQAST platform; designed it with a focus on accessibility for students, researchers, and policymakers; and built and tested the tool end-to-end independently to support data accessibility in environmental research. In the realm of NLP, he conducted the Gojek Driver Sentiment Analysis project, for which he executed comprehensive data cleaning including casefolding, symbol removal, slang normalization, and stopword removal, then manually labeled the review data to create a ground truth dataset, and finally developed and compared both classical machine learning models like Logistic Regression and Linear SVC with deep learning GRU models to classify sentiment. His data engineering skills are evident in his ETL Pipeline for Product Data project, where he built an extraction utility using BeautifulSoup to scrape web data; created a transformation utility to handle data cleaning and preparation; developed a loading utility to save the processed data into a CSV file, Google Sheets, and a PostgreSQL database; and implemented unit tests for all pipeline utilities to ensure reliability and facilitate bug detection. He also built a Movie Recommendation System, a project in which he conducted Exploratory Data Analysis on user ratings and movie data to understand underlying patterns; performed data preprocessing to prepare the dataset for model training; and implemented a content-based filtering model using cosine similarity and a collaborative filtering model using a deep learning-based RecommenderNet. Further showcasing his skills, he developed an Air Quality Data Analysis Dashboard, where he conducted an analysis of air pollution across multiple stations in China and then developed and deployed an interactive dashboard using Streamlit to the Streamlit Community Cloud for public access. His machine learning work includes Customer Segmentation for Beverage Sales, for which he performed Exploratory Data Analysis to gain insights into the customer dataset and executed thorough data preprocessing steps including handling missing values, duplicates, normalization, outlier treatment, feature encoding, and binning. In climate science, he developed the Nino 3.4 Index Prediction Using Deep Learning project, where he conducted EDA and prepared time-series data using a sliding window technique, then developed and compared predictive models using both Random Forest and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithms. Finally, in image processing, he completed a Scientific Image Classification project, for which he prepared and augmented the image dataset to improve model robustness and then developed and trained an image classification model to categorize the images.

Beyond his technical and academic work, Konstan actively seeks global perspectives on sustainability and innovation. He participated in "The Life Programme 2024" in Malaysia, an immersive program on sustainability and youth empowerment, and engaged in workshops on climate action at the "Regen Asia Summit 2025" in Singapore. His academic and research contributions have been recognized with honors such as achieving the Dean's List in his third semester for a GPA above 3.75, receiving the Best Poster Award at the 6th ITB International Graduate School Conference, and being named a Top 10 Winner in the Zencore Legends competition by Zenius in 2021.
