ABOUT
Konstan Aftop is a Machine Learning Engineer with a strong interdisciplinary foundation that combines atmospheric science and artificial intelligence. His primary academic background is in Meteorology, complemented by a minor in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence from the School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics (STEI), Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB). This academic path has enabled him to integrate scientific understanding of the environment with modern AI-driven approaches.

His work spans the development of end-to-end AI systems involving spatial data, audio signal processing, and time series forecasting. Notable projects include a real-time baby cry classification system that provides tailored parenting recommendations and climate data analysis supporting hydropower plant resilience. Konstan's transition into data science is driven by curiosity, adaptability, and a commitment to lifelong learning—qualities that allow him to work effectively across disciplines while maintaining a deep technical focus. He is particularly passionate about applying AI to environmental and public-impact challenges, yet remains open to exploring various domains where scalable AI solutions are needed.

WORK EXPERIENCE

In early 2025, Konstan joined the DBS Foundation Coding Camp as a Machine Learning Engineer cohort member. During the program, he collaborated with a multidisciplinary team to build SuaTalk, a mobile web application designed to detect the cause of a baby's cry and deliver personalized recommendations to parents. His primary responsibility was developing and optimizing the audio classification model. Through iterative tuning and architectural experimentation, he successfully improved the model’s accuracy to 91 percent. He also coordinated closely with the backend team to deploy the trained model into a real-time web interface, and integrated the classification output into a generative AI system powered by Google Vertex AI to generate personalized care suggestions.

Later that year, he contributed as a Climate Data Analyst in a collaborative project between ITB and PLN. His role focused on analyzing rainfall projections from global climate models (GCMs) to inform energy resilience planning for hydropower infrastructure. He carried out statistical downscaling, rainfall variability analysis, and visualization using tools such as Xarray and Matplotlib. His work supported long-term energy policy considerations grounded in climate data.

PROJECTS

SuaTalk – Baby Cry Cause Detection and Recommendation Web App
Team Project | Deep Learning for Audio
Konstan served as the Machine Learning Engineer for SuaTalk, a web-based mobile application that helps new parents understand the reasons behind their baby’s crying. He improved the model’s accuracy to 91 percent by addressing dataset imbalance and refining the architecture of the artificial neural network. In addition, he led the integration of classification results with fine-tuned language model prompts using Google Vertex AI to deliver actionable treatment advice. He also worked alongside backend engineers to ensure the model was efficiently deployed for real-time inference.

Rain Classifier – WCPL ITB
Personal Project | Automation & Meteorological AI
To support weather forecast verification efforts, Konstan developed a Python-based tool that automatically classifies rainfall intensity from forecast maps generated by the WCPL model. By applying pixel-level color extraction and thresholding, the tool can identify rainfall categories such as no rain, light, moderate, and heavy rain. This project reduced manual interpretation tasks in a meteorology course by 50 percent. The tool was deployed using GitHub Actions to automate daily classification processes and ensure consistency across datasets.

PM2.5 HAQAST Downloader GUI
Personal Project | Environmental Data Access Tool
Konstan independently created a graphical user interface (GUI) tool that allows users to download PM2.5 pollutant data from the HAQAST platform without writing code. The application, built using requests and tkinter, is targeted at non-programmers such as students, researchers, and policymakers. The design emphasizes simplicity, accessibility, and reliability, making it easier for users to access critical air quality data for analysis and decision-making.
